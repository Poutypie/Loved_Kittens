Hello! this is PoutyPie!

this is the first game i am creating. it's not ready and complete yet.
this game is made with python pygame, and i'm going to work on it more in future.

recently, i'm working on it's kittens, trying to make them as cute as possible.
also this is the first time i'm publishing something on github, i'm exited and
having problems and challenges, i have plans for the future of this game, that
if i finish it's main simple parts, i'll be working on them.

here are my goals and plans for the future, i don't know how to make them come
true, yet, but i'll try my best:

_first of all, i'll change and expand the settings, really want to make it more 
customizable and with more variety, more adorable and cute.
    ex --> letting the user to choose his/her human by him/herself.
    ex --> letting the user to mute the cat noises, etc noises.
    ex --> letting the user to choose the bullet appearance
    !! or even making some assets locked that if the user got a certain amount 
    of points, he/she be able to get and use them.

_my other plan is to save all versions of this game, so if i messed up, i'll be
able to clean my mess and do not get ***up.

_the third plan is to learn how can i make the kittens move, like gifs, with
different chain pics, (if possible), i don't like dead pics i had placed for the 
human and kittens.

_in the end, i really like to make an apk of this game in the future, so most of
my friends and relatives be able to play it and praise me, (you know, for
motivation!).


thank you for playing my game, it really means to me.

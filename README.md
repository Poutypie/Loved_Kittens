Hey! this is PoutyPie 🐱🎮!

here's the first game i am creating. 


## Built With
- Python 3.11.0
- Pygame 2.6.1

## Project Status
 - in progress...
 - i'm still learning and currently inactive 👻

## ToDo List
 - [x] making kitten lines
 - [x] cleaning messy codes
 - [x] kittens' movements
 - [x] love bullet collision with kittens
 - [] game over
 - [] adding buttons

## Ideas and Future Plans
 - more customizable improved settings and features:
   - users to be able to choose the human by themselves.
    
 - noises for kisses and kittens
   - users to be able to change noises and mute or etc.

 - users to choose the bullet appearance

 - making some assets locked so if users got a certain amount of points, they be able achieve and use them!😺

 - more variety

 - save different versions for safety 👽

 - Animate kittens 

 - maybe apk ver?
